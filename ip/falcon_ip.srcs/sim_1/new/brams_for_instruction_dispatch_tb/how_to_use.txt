Subfolders of current folder contain the .coe files that should be loaded into the BRAMs
in order to run dispatch_unit_tb.

The easiest way to load the data is by copying the contents of each .coe file into the
corresponding BRAM initialization file, which are located in the /ip/falcon_ip.srcs/sources_1/coefficients/ directory (bramX.coe files).
After this you should right click on the BRAM ip in the Design sources and click "Reset Output Products"
and then "Generate Output Products".
